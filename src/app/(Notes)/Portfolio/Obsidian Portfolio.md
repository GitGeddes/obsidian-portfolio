# Obsidian Portfolio
A GitHub portfolio styled after the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking app.
####
This portfolio was built from scratch with my previous [[React]] skills I learned while building [[Groupie]].

####
**Source code:** [obsidian-portfolio](https://github.com/GitGeddes/obsidian-portfolio)

**Website:** [GitHub Pages](https://gitgeddes.github.io/obsidian-portfolio/)

## Framework
Created with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## My Obsidian
This is what my real Obsidian Vault looks like. I used it as a reference for the styling on my portfolio site:

## Documentation
I generated a [documentation site](https://gitgeddes.github.io/obsidian-portfolio/docs/index.html) using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) and manual comments just for fun.
