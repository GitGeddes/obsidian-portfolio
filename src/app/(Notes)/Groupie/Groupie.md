# Groupie
### Co-Founder, Full Stack Engineer
#### July 2020 - January 2025
Developed Groupie, a social media app that lets users share their favorite Spotify albums, songs, and playlists. As the sole developer
for both Android and iOS, I used TypeScript and React Native to build the app for over 2,500 users.
- Built the platform from scratch, including features like a timeline, messaging, friends, search, notifications, and caching.
- Created a custom Google Firebase user database for a responsive and highly available back-end.
- Integrated the Spotify API to pull music data and enhance the user experience.
- Optimized and refactored the app in TypeScript using React Native best practices to improve performance and extensibility.
- Developed a custom unit test suite with Jest to ensure code quality and to catch issues early.
